	<p>Soon after arriving at <a href="http://www.nichols-co.com">The Nichols Company</a>, I quickly realized that we needed a simple, but effective, way of securely posting web-based galleries of photo-shoots for clients to review.</p>
	
	<p>The web application runs locally on the in-house server and provides easy access for the design team to upload galleries themselves by simply resizing images and saving them to mounted share points.</p>
	
	<p>The application then realizes that there is new content in the filesystem, and from that point the designer simply adds some descriptive album text, registers it with the database and e-mails a link to the client.</p>
