	<p>This was a simple, yet <em>fun</em>, project completed for the "ultra-small web and application development studio", <a href="http://www.aspiringindie.com/">Aspiring Indie</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Normally, basic slice and code jobs involving rounded corners and shadow work like these are a pain. However, because the client absolutely <strong>rocked</strong> I was allowed to play around with some of the new capabilities of the upcoming CSS3 specification to my hearts content.</p>
	
	<p>In the end, the design became a great looking theme (eventually be to be turned into a Wordpress theme) that was easy to put together, and most importantly <strong>fun</strong> to work on. The result? A very happy client and an even happier developer.</p>
	
	<p>Graceful enhancement. What a fantastic concept.</p>
